# Week 3-Advanced-Excel-Functions
Introduction

This week, I spent time practicing a wide range of Excel formulas and functions that help with calculations, finding information, cleaning text, and even making decisions automatically. I also worked with dates and times, which are very useful when dealing with schedules, deadlines, or any time-related data.

What I Did in This Dataset

1. Basic Calculations & Summary Functions

I practiced several formulas that quickly calculate things like totals, averages, and the highest or lowest values in a list. These are helpful when working with large amounts of numbers.

SUM: Adds up numbers.

MAX: Finds the biggest number.

MIN: Finds the smallest number.

COUNT: Counts how many numbers are in a list.

LARGE: Finds the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd largest number, etc.

SMALL: Finds the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd smallest number, etc.

MEDIAN: Finds the middle value.

MODE: Finds the number that appears most often.

2. Conditional Calculations (Only If Certain Conditions are Met)

I also used formulas that calculate things only if they meet specific criteria (for example, adding up sales only for a certain product or in a certain month).

SUMIF / SUMIFS: Adds numbers that match certain conditions.

COUNTIF / COUNTIFS: Counts how many items match certain conditions.

MINIFS / MAXIFS: Finds the smallest or largest number that meets certain conditions.

AVERAGEIF / AVERAGEIFS: Finds the average of numbers that match certain conditions.

3. Working with Text Data

I also practiced cleaning and combining text, which is important when dealing with names, addresses, or other text-based data.

PROPER: Fixes text so the first letter of each word is capitalized (e.g., "kevin cookie company" → "Kevin Cookie Company").

TRIM: Removes extra spaces from text.

CONCAT: Combines text from different cells into one.

RIGHT / LEFT / MID: Pulls part of the text from the right, left, or middle of a cell.

LEN: Counts how many characters are in a cell (including spaces).

FIND & SEARCH: Looks for a specific word or letter inside a cell and tells me its position.

4. Logical Functions (Making Decisions Automatically)
These are functions that let Excel make decisions based on conditions I set. They are super helpful when creating things like grading systems or custom labels.

TRUE & FALSE: These are basic outputs Excel gives when checking if a condition is correct or not.

IF: This formula checks if a condition is true and gives one result if it is, and a different result if it’s not.

Example: If a score is 60 or above, show "Pass"; if not, show "Fail."

AND: Checks if multiple conditions are all true at the same time.

OR: Checks if at least one condition is true.

Nested IF / IFS: Combines multiple IF statements to handle more complex conditions.

5. Working with Dates and Times

I also practiced how to handle dates and times in Excel. This is useful when working with deadlines, schedules, or tracking how much time has passed.

What I Learned
This week, I got comfortable using many important Excel functions. I can now:

Quickly calculate totals, averages, and find specific values.

Clean and combine messy text data.

Automatically make decisions in my spreadsheet based on conditions.

Work with dates and times in a way that makes sense for reports and analysis.
